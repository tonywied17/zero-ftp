# Type Alias: FtpPassiveHostStrategy

```ts
type FtpPassiveHostStrategy = "advertised" | "control";
```

Defined in: [src/providers/classic/ftp/FtpProvider.ts:142](https://github.com/tonywied17/zero-transfer/blob/228e6788135e03ac23cdff1b250339621f97317b/src/providers/classic/ftp/FtpProvider.ts#L142)

Host selection strategy for PASV data endpoints.

`control` connects data sockets back to the control connection host, which avoids
broken private or unroutable PASV addresses from NATed servers. `advertised` uses
the host supplied by the server's PASV response for deployments that require it.
